.. title: raspberry pi

If you would like to contribute code, there are a few workflows listed below (NOTE: there may be better ways to do this!  If you are a smart github user and you find yourself laughing at the instructions below, please improve them :).

* ("Simple") Create a fork of this repo, clone it to your PI, checkout the `develop-raspberrypi` branch on, make changes and then submit a pull requests back to to the `openFrameworks-RaspberryPi/openFrameworks` repo.  This is the normal openFrameworks way of doing things.


* (Advanced) Alternatively, if you already have a fork of the original `openFrameworks/openFrameworks` repo (which many of you probably do) you may want to create a branch off of your own fork that tracks with the `develop-raspberrypi` branch of this fork (I know ... it sounds complicated, but it will work, I promise).  To go this route:
    * Set up git on your RPI using the account info associated with your fork [Setup Guide](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git#platform-all) 
    * On your RPI, create a clone of your personal fork and checkout the `develop` branch:
        * `git clone git@github.com:<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/openFrameworks.git`
        * `git checkout develop`
    * (if needed) Make sure your fork is up to date with the `openFrameworks/openFrameworks` develop branch by:
        * `git remote add upstream git remote add upstream git://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks.git`
        * `git pull upstream develop`
        * `git push origin develop`
    * Now create your own branch to track with the `develop-raspberrypi` branch
        * `git checkout develop`
        * `git branch develop-raspberrypi`
        * `git checkout develop-raspberrypi`
    * Pull all of the recent commits from this `develop-raspberrypi` branch into YOUR tracking branch
        * `git pull git://github.com/openFrameworks-RaspberryPi/openFrameworks.git develop-raspberrypi`
    * Now push your new branch back to your fork's origin on github:
        * `git push origin develop-raspberrypi`
    * **Now make changes to the source code!**
    * Add changes to a commit.
        * `git add YOUR_CHANGED_FILE.cpp`
    * Commit your change set:
        * `git commit -m "A descriptive message about your changes here ..."`
    * Push commit to your fork's origin on github:
        * `git push origin develop-raspberrypi`
    * Now get back in your browser, head over to your fork's page and submit a pull request FROM `<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/openFrameworks` `develop-raspberrypi` TO `openFrameworks-RaspberryPi/openFrameworks` `develop-raspberrypi`.  You may have to search a little bit to find it.  You _don't_ want to submit a PR back to the original `openFrameworks/openFrameworks` branch repo.  Then ask a fellow developer to check out your PR and / or merge the pull request.
    * Rinse and repeat.
    * When you notice that new code has been added to the openFrameworks-RaspberryPi/openFrameworks develop-raspberrypi branch, you can pull in those changes to your branch by the same command as earlier.
        * `git pull git://github.com/openFrameworks-RaspberryPi/openFrameworks.git develop-raspberrypi`
