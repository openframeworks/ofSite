## Classes for playing sound files and sound input and output

This module contains classes that do two main functionalities:

Load and playback sound files through [ofSoundPlayer](ofSoundPlayer.html)

Read and write sound directly from/to the sound card with [ofSoundStream](ofSoundStream.html)

[ofSoundBuffer](ofSoundbuffer.html) can be used in combination with [ofSoundStream](ofSoundStream.html) or with external libraries to manipulate sounds, like crop them, append a sound buffer to another, change its rate...
