This tutorial contains a short introduction to the distributed version control system **git**, why it's a good idea to use it when coding, and its usage in connection with openFrameworks and [github](www.github.com).

You will learn how to create a git repository, start a simple OF project and use git to track your changes. You will also learn how to accomplish the most frequent tasks in git.

## Git basics

### Why version control?

Version control is a tool which enables you to easily preserve history, changes, and different variants of code you write.
It is an immeasurable improvement over not keeping backups, or backing up manually via zipping your program's folder or a similar mechanism.

Furthermore, it enables you to cooperate with others on code in a meaningful and efficient way, so there's really no reason not to do it, it is definitely gonna make your life much easier.

### Basic info about git

[Git](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_%28software%29) is the version control system of choice for openFrameworks and github, so this is what we are gonna use. 
It is a so-called [distributed revision control system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_revision_control), which basically means it's not necessary to have a central server/repository running for using it.

If you have just discovered git, there are a couple of resources you should look through before continuing with this tutorial. They *teach you the basics of how to use git*. After that, we will touch upon some of the things that will come up when you're using git with OF.

[gitref.org](http://gitref.org/) is a nice and concise reference of the essentials of git. It takes about 30min to read through, and you'll come out smarter at the end.

[The github help page](http://help.github.com/) deals with basis usage, concepts and terms of git and github. It is good to get a first idea about the stuff you can typically do with git.

## Using git with OF projects

If you want to use git with your projects, it makes sense to **start as early as possible**, ideally before you even start coding.

Following are some noteworthy things to mention, aside of basic usage, which is covered by the links in the previous section.
	
### Ignoring improper files
It's important to **only have git track the right files**.
Auto-generated files, temporary files, binaries, user-specific files should not be part of the repository, since they are either generated by the source code in the repository, or too specific to a certain user.

In git, you have the possibility to specify elaborate ignore patterns using `.gitignore` files (mind the `.`). 
A **pre-made `.gitignore` file** with typically useful options is already part of your project, if you generated it with the project generator.
A useful collection of `.gitignore` files for a wide variety of situations can be found [here](https://github.com/github/gitignore).

Be aware that files which are already part of the repository are not ignored. 
Also, once files are added to the repository, they become part of the history and are there to stay. This way, it's very easy to unnecessarily bloat your repository size because there's no easy way to purge erroneously added files from the repository (especially if you have already pushed your repo online).
For these reasons, it's **really important** to be attentive when adding files to your repository. 

### Git GUIs
If you don't want to use the command line, there is a number of visual git clients out there you can use.
Stackoverflow has a nice collection of candidates for [Linux](http://stackoverflow.com/q/2141611/599884), [MacOS](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/455698/best-visual-client-for-git-on-mac-os-x) and [Windows](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/157476/what-guis-exist-for-git-on-windows).

### Remotes: origin and upstream
[Remotes](http://gitref.org/remotes/) are identifiers for remote repositories your repository might want to interact with. 
They make it easy to access those repositories without typing URLs all the time.
It is customary to name the copy of your own repository (e.g. on github) `origin`. This is automatically done if you `git clone` a repository from github.
Additionally, if your repository is a fork of another repository, e.g. if you have your own copy of OF, that repository is normally called `usptream`.

### git, coming from SVN
If you come from SVN, and want to jump into git, things can be confusing. There are some resources on the web, one tutorial explaining the equivalent commands can be found [here](http://git.or.cz/course/svn.html).
One thing to note is that a commit is much less serious in git, since it will remain in your local repository. In git, **"commit early, commit often"** is the key.

Another distinction is that you got your own repository is much more separate from a central repository.

Also, merging and branching are things which are central to how git works, so use it liberally.

### Pushing new branches to github
If you have some new work in a separate branch, and you want to push this to your github repository, you say
	git push origin new-work
	
### Creating a local copy of a branch on a remote
If you want to check out a branch on a repository, which does not yet exist in your local repository, you use
	git fetch origin
	git checkout --track origin/interesting-branch
The second command creates a local branch named `interesting-branch` that matches the `origin/interesting-branch` branch and tells git that you want to be able to easily push and pull from the branch on the remote.

### Deleting branches on a remote
If you have worked on some branch, for example for a pull request to get some bug fixes into OF, and you don't need this branch any more, e.g. if the PR has been merged already, then you can delete the branch on the remote by saying
	git push origin :old-branch

### Git workflow for contributing to OF
[This](https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/wiki/openFrameworks-git-workflow) is a document which describes the workflow the OF devs follow when developing. 
If you want to successfully contribute code to openFrameworks, you should follow this document.
It's also useful to look at it if you want to pick up some *tips for managing larger projects*.

## Solutions for commonly occuring problems

There are certain problematic situations which you are probably going encounter when working with git.
In what follows, some of these situations are identified and a solution method is identified.

### Pulling when you have uncommitted changes
If you have uncommitted changes, but you're not yet ready to commit, and want to update your working branch by pulling from a remote, it will fail because git refuses to pull. 

A way around this is to use `git stash`.
This is a really useful [feature](http://gitready.com/beginner/2009/01/10/stashing-your-changes.html) similar to a clipboard, where you can temporarily store changes while doing something else.
There's [an extensive array of options](http://linux.die.net/man/1/git-stash)
Typically, you'll only need `git stash`, which pushes the current changes onto the stash, and `git stash pop`, which pops the latest stash set back again.
So, in the present case, you would do

	<code a bit>
	git stash
	git pull upstream develop
	git stash pop
	<continue work>

## More git resources:

If you want to learn some more tricks, want to get more in-depth info, or run into a problem not mentioned in this tutorial, here's a collection of resources you should consult:

[The oF git cheat sheet](http://piratepad.net/ofgitcheatsheet): A small list of **helpful git commands put together by oF developers**.

[Pro Git](http://progit.org/): A book, also freely available on the homepage in html form. Deals with everything from git basics to advanced concepts.

[The git man pages](http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/): The manual of git. Also available on your command line, but much more readable on the net. :D Bare-bones explanation of the details of command line git usage.

If you ever have a question about how to do things in git, it is often best to enter your question on [Stack overflow](http://www.stackoverflow.com). Most probably someone there has had your problem before. For example, [How do I make git ignore mode changes?](http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=How+do+I+make+git+ignore+mode+changes)

There is also a great amount of articles, wiki pages, tutorials and blog posts about git, for example [git for the lazy](http://spheredev.org/wiki/Git_for_the_lazy) or [Git Immersion](http://library.edgecase.com/git_immersion/index.html).
