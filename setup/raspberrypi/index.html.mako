Raspberry Pi
============

## What is the Raspberry Pi?

The [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) is a small, inexpensive ARM-based computer that is often used with Linux. Compared to a modern Desktop computer the Raspberry Pi is limited in RAM and CPU power, however its chipset supports modern technologies such as OpenGL ES2 and hardware accelerated audio/video processing. These capabilities make the Raspberry Pi an exceptional platform for multimedia applications.


## openFrameworks on the Raspberry Pi
Starting with version 0.8, openFrameworks now supports ARM based devices running Linux. Like on the desktop based platforms, openFrameworks provides a common interface to create applications that incorporate real-time graphics, shaders, audio/video processing, networking. openFrameworks addons (commonly referred to as ofxAddons) also provide a common pathway to other popular technologies like OpenCv, OSC, etc

openFrameworks supports the Raspberry Pi via the recommended Linux distribution Raspbian "Wheezy" (hard float).
