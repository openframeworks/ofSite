Raspberry Pi
============


Currently Raspberry Pi development is happening through a loose loose affiliation of folks with a passion for the PI.  You are invited to join us!  If you are interested in contributing in any way, please get in touch with anyone below who seems to share your interests, hop on the ofdev IRC channel and add yourself to the list.  Much of our discussion is currently happening in the issues section of this repo.

While we don't have section leaders per se, there are a few folks who are particularly committed to seeing certain aspects of the oF core working on the RPI.  If you'd like to take on a little more responsibility (namely taking a deeper look at pull requests and testing them), please contact me @bakercp and I'll add you to the repo.

* Christopher Baker (bakercp) http://christopherbaker.net I'm interested in seeing this thing float!
* Matt Richardson http://mattrichardson.com - available for testing, feedback. General RPi enthusiast.
* Andrew Lovett-Barron http://readywater.ca - Free for dev, testing, feedback, etc. I'm doing some CV work with the Pi in December, happy to contribute anything in that space as well.
* Jason Van Cleave, http://jvcref.com did an early headless port for the rPI and some other ARM ports (Chumby/Beaglebone) , will probably try and get the Kinect working with it via ofxKinect/OpenNI - interested to see a ofxGPIO<--Same
    * jvcleave's notes here: http://piratepad.net/TyJYAizBH3
* Andreas Borg https://crea.tion.to/ ready to get my hands dirty. Excited to see if the RPI is powerful enough to run generative art apps with proper antialias. So focus will probably be SVG rendering. I'm in NY. Happy to meet up anytime.
* sander ter braak, http://www.hautetechnique.com. available for testing, feedback etc.. i'm going to try to spend some time on the ofxNetwork addon these weeks. It looks like it's depending on the ofxThread, so i will try to get that up and running as well.
* Dan Moore, @theDANtheMAN.  former embedded systems engineer and currently a front end android dev. I worked on Set-Top-Boxes arm and mips chips running QTLinux, Android, and plain linux. I'm based out of NYC.
* Arne Boon, http://www.studioarneboon.nl/, Utrecht, the Netherlands: working on an interactive art+science installation using the RPi and Arduino. Very interested and excited about getting it done on the pi, exhibition opening 7 feb 2013 (http://mediatechnology.leiden.edu/)
