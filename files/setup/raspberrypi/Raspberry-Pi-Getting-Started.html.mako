Getting your Raspberry Pi ready for openFrameworks
============

    
## Install Raspbian "Jessie"
0. Install the latest _**Raspbian** (Debian Jessie)_ image from the [Raspberry Pi downloads page](http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads)
1. Follow the instructions at [Raspberry Pi Preparing Your SD Card](http://elinux.org/RPi_Easy_SD_Card_Setup) to get Raspbian installed onto your SD Card

         
## Configure the Raspberry Pi
This guide assumes you are starting from a fresh Raspian install and that you are able to connect to the Raspberry Pi and send it commands.

You can enter commands on the Pi by:

0. SSH into the Pi from a different computer
0. Attach a keyboard and monitor to the Pi.
	* With Jessie the Raspberry Pi now boots the X11 window system by default, open up LXTerminal from the shortcut on the Raspberry Pi Desktop
	* Type in the command `sudo raspi-config`

_We need to make sure the CPU has 192MB of RAM in order to compile openFrameworks. Once you have compiled openFrameworks you may want to repeat this step with 128_

0.  Select `1 Expand Filesystem` and hit Enter
0.  Select `8 Advanced Options` and hit Enter
	* Select `A3 Memory Split` and hit Enter
	* Type `64` and Hit `<ok>`

openFrameworks does not use the X11 Desktop for running OF applications. You can save GPU memory by disabling it. This is optional but suggested.
 
0. Select `3 Boot Options`
0. Select `B1 Console` or `B2 Console Autologin`

Unlike Wheezy, Debian Jessie does not display the IP address on boot. You may wish to get the current IP by typing `ifconfig`. The IP address is under the eth0 entry for wired ethernet. This can possibly change on reboot. 

0. Reboot when prompted or type `sudo reboot`
0. Assuming you have internet access run these commands to update the software to the latest packages.
    * `sudo apt-get clean`
    * `sudo apt-get update`
    * `sudo apt-get upgrade`
    * _Note: The above steps may take a little while._

## Download openFrameworks
You now can download openFrameworks and uncompress it into a folder. Using a Shell, The following commands will download openFrameworks and uncompress it into the folder `/home/pi/openFrameworks`
 
<h3> For the Raspberry Pi using OF for arm6</h3>
    * `cd` 
    * `curl -O http://www.openframeworks.cc/versions/v0.9.0/of_v0.9.0_linuxarmv6l_release.tar.gz` 
    * `mkdir openFrameworks`
    * `tar vxfz of_v0.9.0_linuxarmv6l_release.tar.gz -C openFrameworks --strip-components 1`

## Install packages and compile openFrameworks:
 Make sure you didn't skip the Memory Split step in the above section _**Configure the Raspberry Pi**_ or it will eventually fail.
 
The time for these steps will depend on whether you are on a RPI1 or RPI2 and the speed of the Raspbian mirrors to download the packages.
Assuming openFrameworks is located at `/home/pi/openFrameworks` run the following commands to install the necessary packages and compile openFrameworks. 

    * `cd /home/pi/openFrameworks/scripts/linux/debian`  
    * `sudo ./install_dependencies.sh` 

You are now ready to compile openFrameworks! 
    * `make Release -C /home/pi/openFrameworks/libs/openFrameworksCompiled/project`

## Speeding up compiling
Compiling natively on the Raspberry Pi takes a long time. openFrameworks applications typically take much less time than the core library. Taking the time to set up a cross-compiling solution will save you enormous amounts of time. 

[Raspberry Pi Cross Compiling Guide](Raspberry-Pi-Cross-compiling-guide.html)

## Compile your first app
openFrameworks ships with a bunch of examples located in the `openFrameworks/examples` folder. Inside examples the projects are sorted by the categories: 

* 3d 
* addons 
* communication 
* empty
* events
* gl
* gles
* graphics
* gui
* math
* sound
* utils
* video

Inside each category folder are a few examples of each. To run them you need to go into the folder, build and run.

For example, here is how you build and run the polygonExample:

* `cd /home/pi/openFrameworks/examples/graphics/polygonExample`
* `make`
* `make run`

Unlike other platforms, OF Raspberry Pi projects do not make use of the projectGenerator. To create your own project from scratch, copy `examples/empty/emptyExample` into `apps/myApps/yourProjectName` folder and start from there

For example:

* `cp -R /home/pi/openFrameworks/examples/empty/emptyExample /home/pi/openFrameworks/apps/myApps/myRpiApp`
* `cd /home/pi/openFrameworks/apps/myApps/myRpiApp`
* `make`
* `make run`

It is critical to keep your application directory 3 levels below the openFrameworks directory.

Have fun! :)
