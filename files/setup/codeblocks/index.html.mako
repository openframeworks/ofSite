code::blocks setup guide
========================

We like Code::Blocks for Windows development since it's light weight, and avoids some of the quirkiness of windows visual studio. here's a step by step tutorial to get up and running.
**Note**: [Step e)](#additions) is required to run openFrameworks. Please do not skip this step. 

Version
------- 
The new version of Code::Blocks (12.11) is not compatible with openFrameworks versions 0073 and lesser. It will work with 0.7.4 (forthcoming) and what's on the develop branch of github. This is because of a change in the compiler which makes libraries compiled with an older compiler incompatible with the newer compiler. If you are using openFrameworks 0073 or lesser, use [Code::Blocks 10.05][0].

Installation
------------ 
**a) Download Code::Blocks binary (latest release)**

> [Download Code::Blocks][1] 
**Note**: download **WITH** MinGW. Code::Blocks version 12.11 works well with openFrameworks 0.7.4+.

**b) Install**

**c) You don't have to change anything**

**d) I chose not too, since Code::Blocks is not my primary IDE**

<a id="additions"></a>**e) Add files to MinGW**

Similar to devcpp, we will have to add a few libraries to devcpp. You can download the files:

> [Additions for Code::Blocks to work with openFrameworks][2]


In the zip there are two folders, you need to put the **contents** of them into the contents of folders in MinGW.

*   Add the _contents_ of the folder "**add\_to\_codeblocks\_mingw\_include**" into "**C:\\Program Files\\CodeBlocks\\MinGW\\include**" (or wherever your app\\mingw\\include is)
*   Add the _contents_ of the folder "**add\_to\_codeblocks\_mingw\_lib**" into "**C:\\Program Files\\CodeBlocks\\MinGW\\lib**" (or wherever your app\\mingw\\lib is)

These are additional libs and header files that need to be added to the MinGW distribution that comes with Code::Blocks. 

Here's a quick video which shows what this should look like: [copy steps for codeblocks][3]
